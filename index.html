    As the software engineer debunked this myth about not collaborting with people, she mentioned that in most of the project you have to
    work with someone, and pairing up in class plays a vital role in developing the skills to communicate and express your ideas to other 
    people. Moreover, this also improves how you treat other people, and makes you more eligible to pick up social ques and norms.

    As mentioned by the engineer, once you are done with your work you hand it to someone else to take a look,
    then they try to debug it. This encourages teamwork, 
    helps other provide a feedback on your work and an insight on how to improve it

    This is more or less the same thing we will practice in class as peer assesment is a vital part of our
    curriculum we will be able to replicate real-world issues within the classroom

    In this class we will learn numerous computer languages, and work on different projects.

    Some of these projects are to be completed in pairs, which not only provides us with the technical skills to do that project, but working with someone 
    else aids us in enhancing our soft skills such as communication and expression of ideas.

    We are paired up with other people, so we need to be careful of being puntual or our partner may suffer.
    Hence, punctuality and availability of required resources is a salient feature in the syllabus, 
    this assists us in feeling for others and how our action may directly or indirectly effect othersâ€™ lives.
